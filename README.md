Hello!

- 17 y/o programmer from Vancouver
- I enjoy making things people might like!
- My most competent languages are javascript and python
- I also use GameMaker Studio 2, I'm currently working on a multiplayer rpg of sorts

_There probably isn't much of interest on my profile... but you can have a look around if you want._
