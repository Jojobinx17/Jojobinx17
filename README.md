# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ #

A little bit about myself...

- I'm a 17 y/o programmer from Vancouver.
- I enjoy making things people might like!
- My most competent languages are vanilla Javascript (yikes) and Python.
- I also use GameMaker Studio 2, I'm currently working on a multiplayer RPG with a server written in Python.

_There probably isn't much of interest on my profile... but you can have a look around if you want._

Enjoy your stay!
